# EmployeeRecordProject

Reading a csv file and sorting out each of the columns of data in the order of the header. The program prints out the data into a PostgreSQL database. The project uses the Mode View Controller (MVC) methodology to organise the written code, so it is reader friendly. Duplicated data hasn't been implemented into the project yet. The project is written in Java.
